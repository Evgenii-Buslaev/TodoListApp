    Hello world!
    That's my first application. It might contain some structural mistakes, but i'm trying to make an application by myself.
    The app is a simple to-do list. You can add some tasks, edit 'em and of course delete. The time block under each task tells you when it was added or edited. Also you can set a deadline (number of hours - integer). The time block under the task may let you know how much time left you've got as well.
